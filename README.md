## üå± What is Open Source?

At some point in your learning or career, you've probably come across the term "open source", right? So... what is it exactly?

> üí° A simple (but not perfect) answer: <br>
> Open source is a development model where software and sometimes hardware, educational content, and more are released under a license that grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code freely.

- so you might ask, "If that's the meaning, then what is open source contribution then?" which leads us to the next section:

## Open Source Contribution

- GitLab

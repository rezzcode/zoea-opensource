## 🌱 What is Open Source?

At some point in your learning or career, you've probably come across the term "open source", right? So... what is it exactly?

> 💡 A simple (but not perfect) answer: <br>
> Open source is a development model where software and sometimes hardware, educational content, and more are released under a license that grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code freely.

- so you might ask, "If that's the meaning, then what is open source contribution then?" which leads us to the next section:

## Open Source Contribution

Open source contribution is the act of participating in an open source project by providing any form of input that helps improve the project. Many might think it's just about writing code, but that's not it; it encompasses a wide range of activities! Contributions also don’t just happen on GitHub; there are many platforms like:

- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- SourceForge
- OpenCollective
- Dev.to


## 💡 Ways You Can Contribute

In general, Open Source contribution depends on what you like and would want to contribute to.

### Coding Contributions

2. Bug Fixes – Identify and resolve issues
3. Refactoring – Clean and optimise existing code
4. API Design – Improve or maintain public interfaces
5. Performance Optimisation – Make things faster and better
6. Testing/QA – Write or review test cases

- Those are among some ways we can contribute to open source projects. But why should we even contribute to the projects?

Step 3: Clone the forked repo to your machine
</summary>

<br>

- **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** If you're not familiar with Git, using **GitHub Desktop Application** is a better start. If you choose this method, make sure to download it before continuing reading.
>
> ‚ùó‚ùó Access link to download [**here**](https://desktop.github.com).

- **Method 2:** Git

Clone the forked repository. Open git bash and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/zoea-opensource.git
cd zoea-opensource
git config --global user.name "<your GitHub user name>" && git config --global user.email "your GitHub primary email"
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

<details>
<summary>
Step 4: Create a new branch for your changes
</summary>

<br>

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, follow the following steps:

- **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more about how to create a new branch [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches#creating-a-branch) and how to fetch and pull origin from/to your local machine [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch).

Learn more about how to fetch and pull origin from/to your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github/syncing-your-branch).

- **Method 2:** Git

Run the following commands **_carefully_** to update your local repository

```bash
# If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Make a feature branch (Always check your current branch is up to date
# before creating a new branch from it to avoid merge conflicts)
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>

#
```

Step 5: Ready, Set, Go...
</summary>

<br>

- Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing to the project and creating **pull requests**.

### Translation Contribution
- Ensure that you read [Translation Guide for more info on this](https://github.com/rezzcode/zoea-opensource/blob/main/Translations/README.md)
- Once you are done with your translation, edit the [Translation Guide readme](https://github.com/rezzcode/zoea-opensource/blob/main/Translations/README.md) 
to include the language you have translated to and the lint to the file.

**How to do this***
In the [Translation Guide readme](https://github.com/rezzcode/zoea-opensource/blob/main/Translations/README.md), the language of translation will be included inside a `[]`bracket,
 and the link inside a `()`

So it should look something like:
```yaml
[language](link)
```

### Code Snippet Contribution
- Create a folder if you want to contribute a new code snippet in a different language.
  > 1. The folder name **Must** be the name of the language, and the files **must** be relevant to the code you want to submit. <br>
  > 2. The folder created **Must** be added to the path: `Solutions/Snippets`, followed by the language name directory, then the file <br>
  > Example: If the new snippet is in Java programming, the path should be as follows. `Solutions/Snippets/Java/your-file-name.java`
- If your language snipped directory already exists, then add your file to the existing directory

### Guide Contribution
- Ensure your guide is meaningful and beginner-friendly
- Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder.

* **Method 1:** GitHub Desktop

Learn more about how to make pull requests from your local machine using **GitHub Desktop** to the main repo [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/viewing-a-pull-request-in-github-desktop).

- **Method 2:** Git

Add and commit with a clear message using `git add`, `git commit`:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<your message>"
```

Push the code _to your repository_.

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Make sure you have no conflicts. üôÇ üôÇ

Step 6: Open a Pull Request (PR)
</summary>

<br>

Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

- Now wait, until _your Pull Request_ is approved! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
